### hi, i'm helen! ✨

i'm an engineer working on something secret in the **language modeling** space, i.e. teaching machines how to write. 

i'm excited about startups, cities, artificial intelligence, and poetry 💫🌷🔮🌱🌸

**some fun things i've created**

* 🐳 [@whalefakes](https://twitter.com/whalefakes) a Twitterbot built by finetuning GPT-2 on tweets by @awhalefact
* 📈 [Wolfram Beta](http://wolframbeta.art/) if Wolfram Alpha were powered by a tiny neural network 
* 🎲 [Fake Trump](http://faketrump.ai/) a game in the style of arXiv vs. snarXiv
* 🌱 [unnecessary.ai](https://unnecessary.ai/) a place dedicated to capturing the spirit of human creativity + AI
* 🔮 [CALEB](https://www.mathemakitten.dev/caleb/) has crossed time and space in search of the foresight + clairvoyance of Osiris, Thor, Bloomberg and Yahoo! Finance
